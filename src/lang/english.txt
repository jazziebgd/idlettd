STR_HELP_PAGE_INTRO :{STRING} is game script intended for people who share the love script author has for both OpenTTD and idle games alike. It doesn't affect core gameplay at all, the magic happens while you're not playing the game.
STR_HELP_PAGE_TEXT :{YELLOW}Info{}{SILVER}When you save your game, {STRING} will keep record of save date and time and how much money your company earned in the previous year. Later, when you load your saved game it will determine how much (in-game) time passed since saving. That value, along with your last year balance is all it needs to calculate your idle balance. It will then show you a report for you to review and confirm, before changing your bank balance.


STR_HELP_PAGE_NOTES :{YELLOW}Notes{}{SILVER}{NBSP}{NBSP}-{NBSP}Your idle balance {WHITE}can be negative{SILVER} if, in the year prior to saving the game, your company had losses.{}{NBSP}{NBSP}-{NBSP}Report window {WHITE}can not be closed unless you apply idle balance{SILVER}.{}{NBSP}{NBSP}-{NBSP}The script requires {WHITE}Company HQ{SILVER} and {WHITE}one or more running vehicle{SILVER} of any type.{}{NBSP}{NBSP}-{NBSP}You'll have to play game for {WHITE}at least three years{SILVER} in order for {STRING} to have enough data to calculate idle balance.{}{}
