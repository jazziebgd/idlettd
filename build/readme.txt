IdleTTD game script for OpenTTD
Author Dino Ivankov


IdleTTD converts OpenTTD into an idle-like game without affecting core
gameplay. Players can now earn money even when the game is not running.

NOTE: Script is for single player games, won't work in multiplayer mode.

Intro window will open when new game starts, containing some general 
info for the player. 
Other than that, nothing changes in the gameplay until you build your 
Company HQ, save and later load the game. Even the intro window itself 
can be disabled via script settings.

Upon loading a saved game, IdleTTD shows a window with idle balance report 
for player review and confirmation.
Alternatively, if player saved a game without building their Company HQ, 
a window with message warning about Company HQ being required is displayed.
